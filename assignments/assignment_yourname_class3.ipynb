    "For this assignment, you will use the **series-31** dataset.  This file contains a dataset that I generated explicitly for this semester.  You can find the CSV file on my data site, at this location: [series-31](https://data.heatonresearch.com/data/t81-558/datasets/series-31.csv). Load and summarize the data set.  You will submit this summarized dataset to the **submit** function.  See [Assignment #1](https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/assignments/assignment_yourname_class1.ipynb) for details on how to submit an assignment or check that one was submitted.\n",
